# Students Performance Predictor

## Description
This project aims to predict students' academic performance based on various features such as demographic, social, and academic attributes. It uses machine learning models like Random Forest and XGBoost to classify students' final grades.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
- Implementation of machine learning models for classification.
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- Visualization of results.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NathanOpira/Students-Performance-Predictor.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Students-Performance-Predictor
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:

     ```
5. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter Notebooks in the `Notebooks/` directory to explore the data and train models.
2. Use the preprocessed data in the `Data/processed/` directory for training and testing.
3. Evaluate the models and visualize the results.
